# Conjugate-Newton-Method-An-efficient-optimization-algorithm-for-BP-Neural-Network-Training
This repository contains a efficient hybrid optimization method developed by combining Newton's method and Conjugate Direction Method.  It is proved to be twice more efficient than FR Conjugate Gradient Method and Steepest Gradient Method for the training of a four-layer fully connected network.
